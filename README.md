# MarsEyes-AndroidApp

Personal Project

## Description

I have developed a mobile application using React Native for Android, which integrates a public API 
provided by NASA in order to access their official database regarding the Mars Rovers' activity 
(photos taken on Mars). The application includes navigation, state manipulation, fetch requests and 
promises. The application is published on Google Play Store.
